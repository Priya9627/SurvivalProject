Survival Duration Calculator Documentation

Introduction:-

The Survival Duration Calculator is a Python-based project that allows users to calculate the duration of a person's
life in different time units (e.g., months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds) based on their age.
This calculator provides a modular and organized approach to age-to-duration conversion.

Running the Calculator:-

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the survival_duration_calculator.py file.

Run the script with the command: python survival_duration_calculator.py.

Input:-

Enter the age of the person when prompted.

Input the desired time unit for the duration calculation (e.g., months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds).

Output

The calculator will display the calculated duration in the selected time unit.

Code Structure

The Survival Duration Calculator project is organized into a Python script with a structured code base. 
Here is an overview of the code structure:
    
1. SurvivalDurationCalculator class:

The core logic of the calculator is encapsulated in this class.

Conversion factors for different time units are defined as class attributes.

Methods within the class:

age_to_duration(age, time_unit): Calculates the duration based on age and the selected time unit. Returns the duration or
    None if an invalid time unit is provided.

calculate_and_display_duration(age, time_unit): Takes user input, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

2.if _name_ == "_main_": block:

The entry point of the program.

An instance of the SurvivalDurationCalculator class is created.

User input for age and the desired time unit is obtained.

The calculator's calculate_and_display_duration method is called to provide the result.

Example Usage

Enter the age of the person: 10

Enter the desired time unit (e.g., months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds): weeks

Output:
The person has lived for 120 months. 

Conclusion

The Survival Duration Calculator is a simple and user-friendly tool for calculating the duration of a person's
life in various time units. The modular code structure allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
