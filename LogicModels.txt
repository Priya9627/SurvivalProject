Logic/Models :-
    
SurvivalDurationCalculator is a class that encapsulates the logic of the calculator.

The conversion factors for different time units are defined within the class.

The age_to_duration method calculates the duration based on the age and the selected time unit.

The calculate_and_display_duration method takes user input, calculates the duration, and displays the result.

The if _name_ == "_main_": block is the entry point of the program, where an instance of the SurvivalDurationCalculator class is created, and the calculation is performed.
